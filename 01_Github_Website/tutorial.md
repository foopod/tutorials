Now that your repo exist on Github you can clone it on your computer. You can do this by taking the link from this page. In my case `https://github.com/foopod/site.git`.

Open up Terminal (Mac or Linux) or your Git Shell (Windows).

`git clone https://github.com/foopod/site.git`

This will clone your repo to your computer.

```
foo-pc: foo$ git clone https://github.com/foopod/site.git
Cloning into 'site'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
Checking connectivity... done.
```
